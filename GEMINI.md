# Jekyll Leaflet Plugin

This project is a Jekyll plugin named `jekyll-leaflet`. It allows embedding interactive Leaflet.js maps directly into Jekyll pages using a Liquid tag. The plugin is authored by Ben Mordue and is licensed under MIT.

The core logic is contained in `lib/jekyll-leaflet.rb`, which defines the Liquid tag and generates the necessary HTML and JavaScript for the map.
